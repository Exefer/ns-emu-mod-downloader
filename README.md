# ns-emu-mod-downloader

A simple command-line tool for downloading mods for Switch emulators.

Currently, Ryujinx and derivatives are not supported.

I'm still learning Rust, so expect improvements over time.

## Sources

Mods are downloaded from:

* [Yuzu Mod Archive](https://github.com/eden-emulator/yuzu-mod-archive)
* [switch-ptchtxt-mods](https://github.com/theboy181/switch-ptchtxt-mods)

Thanks to these projects for making such helpful repositories!
