# ns-emu-mod-downloader

A simple command-line tool for downloading mods for Switch emulators.

Ryujinx and derivatives are not supported.

I'm still learning Rust, so expect code improvements over time.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble downloading mods for a specific game version you have installed, and you are certain that mods for that version are available, try toggling the "Scan Subfolders" option on and off in your game directories on your emulator, then re-run the tool.
